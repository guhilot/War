1) After running and starting the game
2) Press enter for a new round or any key to exit the game
3) If you exit the game before it ends the winner will be decided bases on number of cards in hand
4) If the users both throw a card with same weight a war is declared at this time each user removes
   two more cards from hand, from theses two cards only one will be used to break the tie, the winning
   card takes all, however, if there is another tie the war continues and the players dray two more cards
   and only use one to compare and break tie, this process goes on till a winner is decided and hence the
   winner take all cards on table
5) In the event if a user throws one card which results in war and only has one card in hand the game is 
   declared in favor of team who can provide all cards for war to take place ie. two cards
6) The system prompts the user if they want to shuffle cards at 50 turn intervals in case there is a need 
   to shuffle to break long loops


Experiment:
Had two volunteers play the game and the results were as I expected with and wide average game length of 
600 to 1500 rounds, volunteers reported scenarios with player not having enough cards during war, scenario 
where wars took place back to back as the most complex cases, or coming to a deadlock where its a back and 
forth match(case for shuffling), these scenarios have been coded to function properly. At the end the 
volunteers decided to never play this game again --lol

Time and Ideas:
If I were given more time and had the bandwith after work, I would definetely research into how I could 
use React to give this game a UI on the web where two people sitting anywhere in the world could play it
I would also add unit tests to make sure it is robust and that I am doing my part, as it is essential for
a good programmer to write his/her own unit tests before walking away, this coding challenge made me brush up
on my python skills and I enjoyed every minute coding with it, I shall do a deep dive into python too and 
redo this assignment to see where I could do better and cut down on some of the complexity
